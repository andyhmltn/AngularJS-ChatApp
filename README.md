AngularJS-ChatApp
=================

Quite a few months ago, I undertook a project to learn EmberJS. It was a chat application that was pretty basic, looked poor and frankly didn't work well. But I have decided to try this project again but this time using AngularJS.

You may notice there isn't much (if anything) here. So come back soon!

Ideas
----------------
* Full message encryption
* User accounts
* Custom chatrooms
* Locked chatrooms
* Share files/links etc
* Markdown chatbox
